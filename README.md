# Project 2 - Flack

A simple chatroom app utilizing FlaskSocket and SocketIO.

Users can:
*Create uniquely named chatrooms
*Message each other within the chatrooms
*Read up to 100 of the messages sent in each room
  
# Files

There are two html files, an index and a chatroom file. The index file lists the current rooms, while the chatroom file mimics the index file but adds messaging functionality.

This was my first real learning experience with JavaScript and the project as a whole was built with love and frustration.
Enjoy!
